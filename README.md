## Projects
### Raksna (Oct â€“ Present)

Plan to develop a Web app which would track the trajectory of the vehicle using the geolocation. The location history is continuously streamed to a remote database and this data is further processed to detect the future trajectory of the vehicle. It also tracks the trajectory of the nearby vehicle thus forming complete network. Whenever the predicted distance of closest approach between two vehicles falls under a certain threshold, the app raises an alarm to alert the driver.

### Football Tracking model using YOLOv8 
[Publication](https://github.com/SouvikMandal007/Football-Tracking)

Developed and trained a deep learning model using Yolov8 on several real-life football images using the concept of object detection hence developed a model to detect the movement of football in videos making it easy to track the ball and analyze the game with improved accuracy.

### Employee Attrition Prediction 
[Publication](https://github.com/SouvikMandal007/Employee-Attrition-Prediction)

This is a machine learning project on employee attrition prediction. Used exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset properly and by plotting a correlation matrix, I got a really good look at how the features relate to each other. After exploring our dataset, used Feature Engineering to create new features and relationships from the current features that we have.

### Retail Price Optimization 
[Publication](https://github.com/SouvikMandal007/Retail-Price-Optimization)

Developed a retail price recommendation system leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize pricing strategies in response to market demand. Implemented data visualization using Seaborn and Plotly to provide actionable insights for business decisions.
